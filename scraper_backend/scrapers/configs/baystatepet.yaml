workflows:
  # Navigate to a product page directly (assuming we feed it URLs or iterate categories)
  # But typically we start with search or category navigation.
  # For migration, we might want to crawl categories.
  
  # Step 1: Handle age gate or popups if any (none seen on home page)
  
  # Step 2: Navigate to category pages (example)
  - action: "navigate"
    params:
      url: "https://www.baystatepet.com/shop-all-dog-food.html"
  
  # Step 3: Wait for product list
  - action: "wait_for"
    params:
      selector: ".product-list"
      timeout: 10

  # Step 4: Extract product links (this would be a separate crawler workflow ideally, 
  # but here we can define how to extract data from a product page if we assume we are ON one)
  
  # REALISTIC WORKFLOW FOR A PRODUCT PAGE (once navigated there):
  - action: "wait_for"
    params:
      selector: "h1"
      timeout: 10

  - action: "extract"
    params:
      fields: ["product_name", "price", "sku", "description", "image_urls", "breadcrumbs"]
